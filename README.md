# Sass Starter

This repo is soley designed to help make getting started with sass a little faster. 

It includes zero styles off the bat except for in `scss/vendors/_normalize.scss` 

Feel free to replace this with another example of normalize, but I thought it would be best to leave it. 

For your projects, I would recommend making a `styles` folder and putting the scss and css folders in that styles folder. 

You can then run `sass --watch {path}/styles/scss:{path}/styles/css` in your terminal to compile your css. 

Happy styling!
